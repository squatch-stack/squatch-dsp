# Squatch Tuner

A guitar and bass tuner core that reads a string to a tenth of a cent, built as a software
strobe. Portable C++17, header-only, no dependencies. It has fixed-size buffers and never
allocates or locks in the audio path, so the same code can run on a Daisy Seed (Cortex-M7), an
ESP32-S3, a Pi 5 LV2 plugin, a desktop plugin and a WebAssembly AudioWorklet.

Measured numbers, with how they were measured and where it fails, are in [RESULTS.md](RESULTS.md).
It is developed here, in squatch-dsp's `blocks/tuner/`, and also published on its own as
[squatch-tuner](https://github.com/squatch-stack/squatch-tuner), with a
[browser demo](https://squatch-stack.github.io/squatch-tuner/). The
`TunerBlock` adapter (`include/squatch/dsp/blocks/tuner.hpp` at the top of the repo) puts it
behind the common `Block` interface, and its hosts are in the top-level `hosts/`.
The docs site has a chapter explaining the design and comparing it with other tuners and methods.

## How it works

```
input (any rate) -> decimate to ~12 kHz -> history -> MPM every 5.3 ms: which note?
                                       \-> strobe bank, every sample: how far off?
                                             -> stiffness-aware fit -> reading
```

1. **Coarse: which note.** The McLeod Pitch Method (normalised square difference) finds the
   period. It runs every hop until a note is found, then every fourth hop to check the note.
2. **Fine: how far off.** This is a software strobe. Each partial k of the note is mixed down
   with a reference at k times the note's frequency, from one 32-bit phase accumulator. It is
   then low-passed by two boxcars a whole number of periods long, which null every other
   partial exactly. The drift rate of each partial's phase is its frequency error, found by a
   weighted least-squares line fit over a sliding window. A parabola fit reads the drift at the
   newest point, so a gliding note is followed without lag. That correction is shrunk by its
   own significance.
3. **Stiffness.** Real strings are stiff, so partial k sits at k·f0·√(1+Bk²). The fit estimates
   B per note and reports the fundamental itself, not the sharp average of the harmonics.
   Measured on real DI, MPM alone reads 2 to 6 cents sharp for this reason.
4. **Robustness.** It handles five problem cases:
   - A partial that disagrees with the rest (hum, a sympathetic string) is dropped.
   - Octave slips in both directions are caught: upwards by the coarse stage, downwards when
     the odd partials of the reference are empty.
   - Readings are withheld once a note has decayed into the room's hum and noise floor.
   - Hum cannot start a note once a real note has been heard.
   - A steady test tone present from power-on still reads.
5. **Polyphonic strum check** (`poly.hpp`). The tuning is known, so each string gets its own
   strobe channels at its target pitch.

The display gets two readings. `hz` follows the string, glide included, and drives the strobe
animation. `steadyHz` is averaged over the window and drives the number and needle.
`strobeTurns[k]` is each partial's phase, for drawing the strobe.

## Use

```cpp
#include <squatch/tuner/tuner.hpp>

static squatch::tuner::Tuner tuner;   // ~128 kB, keep it off the stack

void setup(float sampleRate) {
  squatch::tuner::TunerConfig c;
  c.sampleRate = sampleRate;           // any rate; decimated internally towards 12 kHz
  c.minHz = 38.0f;                     // 27 for a 5-string bass (B0)
  tuner.configure(c);                  // not real-time safe: builds tables
}

void audioCallback(const float* in, int n) {
  tuner.process(in, n);                // real-time safe, any block size
  const auto& r = tuner.reading();
  if (r.valid) show(r.midi, r.cents, r.steadyHz, r.strobeTurns);
}
```

## Layout

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `include/squatch/tuner/` | the core: `tuner.hpp` (mono), `poly.hpp` (strum check), `strobe.hpp`, `phase_slope.hpp`, `partial_fit.hpp`, `period.hpp` (MPM, YIN), `level.hpp`, `decimator.hpp`, `nco.hpp`, `history.hpp`, `common.hpp` |
| `tests/test_core.cpp` | unit tests, built with AddressSanitizer and UBSan; one test counts heap allocations during `process()` (must be zero) |
| `bench/` | the measurement harness: synthetic plucked strings with known truth, real DI evaluation, polyphonic strums, CPU cost; baselines (YIN, MPM, MPM + phase vocoder) behind the same front end |
| `results/` | raw output of `make results`, which RESULTS.md summarises |
| `docs/screens/` | screenshots of the live page |

The hosts are at the top of squatch-dsp:

| Path (from the repo root) | What |
|---|---|
| `hosts/common/` | host layer any front end can reuse: `display.hpp` (note name, steady and fast cents against a run-time A4); `latest.hpp` forwards to the core's lock-free handoff, `include/squatch/dsp/latest.hpp` |
| `hosts/jack/` | `squatch-tuner-live`, the tuner behind a JACK input, and `squatch-tone`, an exact test tone |
| `hosts/web/` | `serve.py` (standard-library bridge: page + Server-Sent Events) and the strobe page |
| `hosts/wasm/` | the browser demo: the core as WebAssembly in an AudioWorklet, the same page with its own input bar, and its tests (`make wasm-test`) |
| `hosts/tests/` | the host layer's tests (ThreadSanitizer) |

## Build, test, measure

In this directory:

```sh
make test      # unit tests (ASan + UBSan); the top-level `make test` runs them too
make all       # tests and the bench programs
make results   # every number in RESULTS.md; needs the Guitar-TECHS DI files (see RESULTS.md)
make lint      # lizard: CCN <= 10, <= 60 lines, <= 5 parameters per function
```

The hosts build from the repo root: `make live` (JACK), and `make test` runs the host tests.

There are no dependencies to fetch: a C++17 compiler is enough. The bench uses only the
standard library.

## Live on a Raspberry Pi

`hosts/jack` runs the core behind a JACK input and `hosts/web/serve.py` streams its readings to
the strobe page in any browser on the network. RESULTS.md, "Live on the Pi 5", has the numbers
from a Pi 5 with a USB audio interface.

```
capture_1 -> jackd (48 kHz, 64 x 3) -> squatch-tuner-live
     JACK realtime thread: Tuner::process() -> Latest<Frame>     (no allocation, locks or I/O)
     main thread, 30 times a second: newest Frame -> one JSON line on stdout
  -> serve.py: page + /events (Server-Sent Events) + /clock + POST /a4 -> browser
```

```sh
make live                                             # needs libjack-jackd2-dev
python3 hosts/web/serve.py -- build/squatch-tuner-live --input 1
build/squatch-tone 110                                # an exact test tone on playback_1
```

- The number and needle show `steadyHz`; the strobe drifts at the fast reading. Rows are
  partials 1, 2 and 4, so a fine error shows first on the bottom row.
- A4 is shared by every viewer (430 to 450 Hz). The polyphonic strum check is not exposed.
- The footer measures input-to-screen latency across the Pi's and the viewer's clocks, and
  shows the Pi's CPU.

## Porting notes

- **Daisy Seed (STM32H750, Cortex-M7 480 MHz).** Use the core as is. It needs single-precision
  floats in the per-sample path, plus a few hundred double operations per second in the fits,
  which the M7's FPU handles in hardware.
- **ESP32-S3.** Its FPU is single precision only. The fit's double sums run in software, so a
  `float` build of `PhaseSlopeWindow` is the first port task. The MPM inner loop should go
  through ESP-DSP's dot product. RESULTS.md has the estimates.
- **Plugins and Pi.** Wrap `Tuner` in the plugin framework.
- **Web.** Done: `hosts/wasm` compiles the same headers with Emscripten and calls `process()`
  from the AudioWorklet's 128-frame callback (`make wasm`, `make wasm-test`).

## The standalone repository

[squatch-tuner](https://github.com/squatch-stack/squatch-tuner) is the easy-to-embed copy: the
same files in a flat layout (`include/`, `bench/`, `tests/`, `hosts/`) plus the built demo in
`docs/`. It is written from this repository by `tools/export-public tuner`, never edited by
hand: its `EXPORTED` file lists a SHA-256 per file and the squatch-dsp commit they came from,
and its CI fails if a file there differs from that list or from squatch-dsp's main branch.
